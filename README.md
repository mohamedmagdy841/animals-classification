# Animals Classification Using PyTorch

### This project classifies 5 different categories of animals, (cats, dogs, elephants, horses, lions) by fine-tuning state-of-the-art EfficientNet_B1 model.

Every part of this project shows how to do the following:

- Visualize and explore the data
- Preprocess the data
- Get weights of a pre-trained model such as EfficientNet_B1
- Fine-tune the model to the specifc problem
- Train the model
- Evaluate the model
- Deploy the model
